"""How can you pick a random item from a list or tuple?

To select a random element from a tuple in Python, you can use the random.choice() function from the random module. Letâ€™s break it down:

Import the random module: First, make sure you import the random module in your code. This module provides various functions for random number generation.
Create a tuple: Define a tuple containing the elements from which you want to select randomly. Remember that tuples are used to store immutable objects
 (i.e., their values cannot change).
Use random.choice(seq): Call the random.choice(seq) function, where seq represents your tuple. This function will return a randomly selected element from the tuple.
