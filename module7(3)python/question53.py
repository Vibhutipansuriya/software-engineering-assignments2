"""How Many Basic Types Of Functions Are Available In Python?

Python provides two basic types of functions:

1)Built-in functions: These are standard functions in Python that are available for use. Some examples of built-in functions include print(), dir(), len(), and abs()

2)User-defined functions: We can create our own functions based on our requirements. To define a function in Python, we use the def keyword. User-defined functions 
allow us to group commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and reuse code contained in them over and over again1.
