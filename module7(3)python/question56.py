"""How can you get a random number in python?

Python defines a set of functions that are used to generate or manipulate random numbers through the random module. 

Functions in the random module rely on a pseudo-random number generator function random(), which generates a random float number between 0.0 and 1.0
These particular type of functions is used in a lot of games, lotteries, or any application requiring a random number generation.

for example
"""
import random
num = random.random()
print(num)
